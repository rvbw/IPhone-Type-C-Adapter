# Charger Design Process

## Step 1: Base Sketch
In this step, I created a 6 sketches: 4 Sketches on the Top Plane, Sketch on the Front Plane and Sketch on the Right Plane to define the base shape of the charger.

### The 4 Sketches:

Additional fillets and small features were added to improve the design.
